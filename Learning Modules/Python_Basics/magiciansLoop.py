##magicians=['alice','david','carolina']	
##for magician in magicians: ##The colon tells python to start a loop
	##print(magician.title()+", that was a great trick!") ##This prints for each instance in the loop because it is part of the loop
	
##print("Thank you, everyone. That was a great magic show!") ##This prints after the loop completes, what separates it? Line space or position?
##update it is bc it was NOT INDENTED

##for value in range(-1,6):
	##print(value)

##RANGE
##numbers=list(range(1,6))
##print(numbers)
